A WooCommerce extension to sync "Buy on Google" orders to your site.

== Description ==

This plugin can be used to sync and manage "Buy on Google" orders using WooCommerce.

This plugin will import Google orders into your WooCommerce orders throughout the day, and adds functionality to the order edit page using Google's API to be able to create shipments, update shipments, issue refunds, cancel line items, and cancel the order (if no shipments have been made/created).

This allows for consolidated order and inventory management if selling on both Google and your site (with inventory management/stock enabled), and works especially well with Google Product Feeds for WooCommerce, so synced order line items are linked to products by ID.

Initially, this was intended to be a premium/paid plugin, but Google just announced today, June 29, 2023, that they will be shutting down the Buy on Google program on September 26, 2023, and I did not want all the hard work that went into this plugin to go to waste.

So hopefully this plugin passes the initial review quickly so that merchants can take advantage of this plugin before the Buy on Google program is shut down.

== This plugin is fully compatible with WordPress Multisite installations, as well as subdirectory installations! Best of all, IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY CODING KNOWLEDGE! ==

== Installation ==

1. Upload `buy-on-google-for-woocommerce` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'WooCommerce' > 'Buy on Google' in the Admin Dashboard to connect your Google account(s)
4. Once a Google account is connected, select the Merchant Accounts to sync (use Ctrl + click to select multiple on desktop), and click the "Sync" button.
3. And that's it! Your orders will sync periodically throughout the day.
